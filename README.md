 Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.


 Password Strength Evaluation & Best Practices

 1. Created Passwords
Examples with varying complexity:
- `apple123` (lowercase + numbers, short length)
- `Apple123` (uppercase + lowercase + numbers)
- `Apple@123` (adds symbol)
- `ApPlE@12345` (mixed case, symbol, longer length)
- `Tr0ub4dor&3x@mpl3!` (complex passphrase style)
- `J7$rNq1zXy!p` (randomized, very strong)

2. Password Strength Test
Tested using:
- [password meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)


| Password           | Strength/Score | Time to Crack | Feedback |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| apple123           | Weak           | Seconds       | Too short, common pattern |
| Apple123           | Weak/Medium    | Minutes       | Slightly better, still predictable |
| Apple@123          | Medium         | Hours         | Add more length & randomness |
| ApPlE@12345        | Strong         | Years         | Good mix, but still pattern-based |
| Tr0ub4dor&3x@mpl3! | Very Strong    | Centuries     | Excellent complexity & length |
| J7$rNq1zXy!p       | Very Strong    | Centuries     | High randomness, secure |

3. Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns (e.g., `Password123`).
- Use passphrases (e.g., `Blue$Tiger!Runs7Fast`).
- Ensure randomness — don’t base passwords on personal info.
- Use a password manager to store and generate secure passwords.
- Never reuse the same password for multiple accounts.

4. Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until it finds the match.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common words/passwords to guess.
- Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked username-password combos from breaches.
- Phishing: Tricks the user into revealing the password.
- Keylogging: Records keystrokes to steal passwords.

5. Complexity vs Security
- Short & simple passwords → Cracked in seconds via brute force.
- Medium complexity → May last hours or days, but still vulnerable.
- High complexity + long length → Resistant to brute force for centuries.
- Randomness is key — predictable substitutions like `P@ssw0rd!` are still weak.

6. Conclusion
Stronger, longer, and more random passwords provide significantly better security.  
Always use a password manager to maintain security without sacrificing usability.
